<p id="first">Win or lose, We are a team and we don't give up, We fight until the end because we can always turn things around. We support one another in everything. The game is never over until that last game point. Being optimistic and finding ways to look on the bright side of things is what make us such a great team. That is why having a team thatr is like family is not going to back-fire on you, you always will have a shoulder to lean on.</p>
